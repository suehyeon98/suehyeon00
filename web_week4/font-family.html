	<p>An exposed concrete frame supports this 4.2-metre-wide skinny house in Melbourne designed by Oliver du Puy Architects to feature meditation spaces. Aptly named Skinny House, the project carves out a quiet, contemplative space on the site of a neglected yard of a 19th-century shop. Oliver du Puy Architects, which is based in Melbourne, built it as a home for a London-based client who is a keen meditator who frequently travels to and from Australia.</p>
